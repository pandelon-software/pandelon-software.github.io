title: Water Privatisation
---

The potential failure of Thames Water, and discussion of potential renationalisation, has, in my opinion, shone a fascinating light on how polarised our discussions have become theses days, and how no one really wants to engage in more nuanced discussion.

I would just like to put my position out there before discussing this any further: I am absolutely of the mind that the water should never have been sold off. This is vital national infrastructure, should we allow anyone - including, potentially, other nations - be in charge of such vital infrastructure. Also, vital infrastructure should be run in a manner that encourages the good maintenance of the entire system, not in a manner that encourages the extraction of as much profit as possible.

With that out of the way, let me get on with the business of a more nuanced discussion of what should be done next.

The two sides that I currently see ar this:
1. we should not be allowing fat cats to profit from our water. We should renationalise now, and screw those who lose out from their shares becoming worthless.
2. Many of these shares are owned by pension companies and it would have a negative affect on all our pensions if we wiped those shares out.

Point 2 is definitely valid, and I don't think should be dismissed too casually. There will be a certain percentage of those shares that are owned by ISAs and Pensions. ISAs in particular, by their very design, are aimed at encouraging saving by those who do not have much money. The annual limits make them an unnatractive proposition for those who are truly welathy. Private pensions are also owned by many people on the bottom end of the wealth ladder, as well as those higher up; and let's not forget the self employed and small business owners, many of whom are not particularly well off.

However, there is a bit more to this issue that I never see discussed: ISAs and Pensions will be very well diversified so shares in water companies will make up only a small percentage of their portfolios. The question then becomes: how much will the value be affected if this investment was wiped out. If it would only knock a penny or two off the value then that is a minor blip (recent events have moved the values by far more than that) and could safely be ignored.

There are other points that I have seen made that don't make a great deal of sense to me. One point I saw made recently regarding the high dividends paid out was that you need to pay shareholders enough of a dividend else they won't want to invest; but it seems to me that if you have to pay shareholders so much in dividends that you can't afford to invest in maintaining pipes to prevent leakage, and can't process enough sewage that you are not polluting rivers to toxic levels, then this surely highlights a massive failure in the idea of private ownership. Am I wrong?
